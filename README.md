# Tensorflow-GPU

This file is for checking if the GPU is actually being utilized by the Tensorflow.

The code is tested on Fashion MNIST, which is a simple dataset.
So, the time difference between the CPU executions and GPU executions might not be too much depending on the specifications of the system.

The time taken by GPU executions is less than the time taken by the CPU execution.
